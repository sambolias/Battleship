CS372 Project 1 Diary

Task: Cleaning Code and Presentation Writeup
Time: 3 hours
Difficulty: 1

Cleaned up code and created presentation slides. The project is now complete and will be
presended 3/3/2017. The processes used to work on this project were all very useful
and I can see how they would be essential to large scale projects. From testing each
small increment of code to making everything neat and understandable, without these
design steps the code would have been less consistent with one style and possibly
hard to understand.

Task: Pair Coding
Time: 3 hours
Difficulty: 3

Created game class and finished linking everything together for a runnable game interface.

Task: Cleaning Code
Time: 2 hr
Difficulty: 1

Seperated classes out into their own files, made all class members private and added in public retrieval functions where needed.

Task: Pair Coding
Time: 2 hr
Difficulty: 3

Worked with Sam to create the player class: iterates through all the ships, prompting the player
for the coordinates of current ship type and then shows the updated board.
Determined that the code needs some cleaning before progressing much further.

Task: Cleaning Code
Time: 30 min
Difficulty: 1

Looked over code and added comments, fixed typos, and determined areas that needed more clarification.

Task: Pair Coding
Time: 2 hr
Difficulty: 3

Worked on code as a pair to establish the ship class and get it printing on the test board output.
We can now place a ship of the available size types with horizontal or vertical orientation and have
coded checking for placing ships on top of each other or off the board. We also have a function to
determine if a space is occupied by a ship. Pair coding was especially useful for this step of the
project as we both had different thoughts on how to implement the ships and worked together to find
something that worked well for the task. I find this to be more beneficial than working on the
code individually and then having an update meeting later to see where everyone is and what they did.
This way we are both up to speed and actively thinking about the next step.

Task: Pair Coding
Time: 1 hr 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Sam to make pseudo code to work out the code's layout for the project.
We now have an rough shell to work with and expand upon as necessary.
We also started some coding for the board class and now have an
empty grid to start adding ships to. The pair coding, though slow, was very useful for keeping
us both on track with what the other thought for possible code implementation.
This makes it easier to keep the code understood by both parties.

Task: Developed User Stories
Time: 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Sam to develop some User Stories for the project and discuss
possible methods of implementing the project design. I felt that the process
was useful for fully evaluating just what it is that we intend to design, and
helps with brainstorming of how to go about doing it.
