Task: Cleaning Code
Time: 30 min
Difficulty: 1

Looked over code and added comments, fixed typos, and determined areas that needed more clarification.

Task: Pair Coding
Time: 2 hr
Difficulty: 3

Worked on code as a pair to establish the ship class and get it printing on the test board output.
We can now place a ship of the available size types with horizontal or vertical orientation and have
coded checking for placing ships on top of eachother or off the board. We also have a function to
determine if a space is occupied by a ship. Pair coding was especially useful for this step of the
project as we both had different thoughts on how to implement the ships and worked together to find
something that worked well for thet task. I find this to be moer beneficial than working on the
code individually and then having an update meeting later to see where everyone is and what they did.
This way we are boh up to speed and actively thinking about the next step.

Task: Pair Coding
Time: 1 hr 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Sam to make psuedo code to work out the code's layout for the project.
We now have an rough shell to work with and expand upon as neccesary.
We also started some coding for the board class and now have an
empty grid to start adding ships to. The pair coding, though slow, was very useful for keeping
us both on track with what the other thought for possible code implementation.
This makes it easier to keep the code understood by both parties.

Task: Developed User Stories
Time: 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Sam to develop some User Stories for the project and discuss
possible methods of implementing the project design. I felt that the process
was useful for fully evaluating just what it is that we intend to design, and
helps with brainstorming of how to go about doing it.
