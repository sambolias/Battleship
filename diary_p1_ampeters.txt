CS372 Project 1 Diary

Task: Pair Coding
Time: 1 hr 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Sam to make psuedo code to work out the code's layout for the project.
We now have an rough shell to work with and expand upon as neccesary.
We also started some coding for the board class and now have an
empty grid to start adding ships to. The pair coding was very useful for keeping
us both on track with what the other thought for possible code implementation,
which makes it easier to keep the code concise and coherent.

Task: Developed User Stories
Time: 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Sam to develop some User Stories for the project and discuss
possible methods of implementing the project design. I felt that the process
was useful for fully evaluating just what it is that we intend to design, and
helps with brainstorming of how to go about doing it.
