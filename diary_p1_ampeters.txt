CS372 Project 1 Diary
Aisha Peters

Date: 2/8/2017
Task: Developed User Stories
Time: 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Sam to develop some User Stories for the project and discuss
possible methods of implementing the project design. I felt that the process
was useful for fully evaluating just what it is that we intend to design, and
helps with brainstorming of how to go about doing it.
