CS372 Project 1 Diary
Sam Erie

Date: 2/8/2017
Task: Developed User Stories
Time: 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Aisha to develop some User Stories for the project and discuss
possible methods of implementing the project design. This process helped
to break the project into simple modules, and to see a way to build less
complicated modules in a way that they will work with more time consuming 
ones like OpenGl if we have the time.
