Finished up subclass work and implemented game loop.
Then plenty of debug. Not perfect but it works as intended.

Difficulty: 1

Worked on the player class, building a command prompt for 
player to be able to place ships a-j on y axis, or 1-10
on x axis, just as in board game. Prompt tells what ships
are being placed and how, repeats for ships with invalid
coordinates, and ends after placing 5 ships. All tests good.

Our second test was to place ships on grid. We planned
how to init our board and ship objects in a way that 
ships had error flag and would only place on board if they 
were on board, and were not overlapping ships. From this we 
ended up for a checkHit() and updateGrid() function and 
much more insight into the overall organization of the final program.

We wrote psuedo code to agree on the start of object structure
for programs. Then we started coding in c++. Creating the game,
player, board, and ship classes. And made our first test to print 
an initialized board grid, which passed. After that some refactoring.

Task: Developed User Stories
Time: 45 min
Difficulty: 1

Worked with Aisha to develop some User Stories for the project and discuss
possible methods of implementing the project design. This process helped
to break the project into simple modules, and to see a way to build less
complicated modules in a way that they will work with more time consuming 
ones like OpenGl if we have the time.
